# Speech Recognition in Healthcare Using Deep Learning

This project performs **multiclass audio classification** on patient-recorded respiratory sounds using deep learning. It aids in early detection of conditions like asthma, pneumonia, and bronchitis by extracting MFCC features from coughs, speech, and breathing.

## Project Overview

- **Domain:** Deep Learning in Healthcare (Audio Processing)
- **Techniques:** MFCC Feature Extraction, CNN, Audio Augmentation
- **Categories Detected:** Asthma, COPD, Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Healthy
- **Best Test Accuracy:** 86.48%
  
## Workflow

1. Load audio dataset and extract MFCC features  
2. Apply data augmentation (noise, pitch shift, time stretch)  
3. Generate spectrograms  
4. Train CNN model  
5. Evaluate using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and AUC  
6. Analyze results and test real-time inputs

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- TensorFlow
- Librosa
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Keras
